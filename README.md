#Water Quality Prediction
This research focuses on predicting water quality using three machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Artificial Neural Network. The study utilizes a dataset based on underground water quality in Telangana districts. The aim is to classify water quality for various purposes like household activities, industrial production, and agricultural irrigation. The accuracy of prediction models is compared to assist government institutions in resource allocation based on water quality predictions. Results indicate that all three models perform well, providing valuable insights for proactive decision-making.
